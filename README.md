## Easy Authentication Mod

Since samo_lego deprecated his mod, I consider updating it to the latest version.

For Minecraft 1.16 and below you can check [original repository](https://github.com/samolego/SimpleAuth).

See [wiki](https://github.com/NikitaCartes/EasyAuth/wiki) for more information.

[My Whitelist mod](https://github.com/NikitaCartes/EasyWhitelist), that changes whitelist behaviour from uuid-based to name-based, allowing it to be use at offline mode
